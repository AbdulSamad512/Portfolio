A sequential model is built with embedding layers and LSTM for extracting temporal patterns, with dense layers for classification. The model is trained and evaluated for accuracy in predicting sentiments (positive or negative). Results are interpreted, and the trained model is ready for deployment in sentiment analysis applications.
