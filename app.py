Dropout layers with rates ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 are incorporated to prevent overfitting. The network is finalized with a Dense layer to output predictions. Designed for input shapes matching the time-series data, the model is trained on preprocessed datasets, leveraging robust recurrent layers. Applications include stock price prediction, weather forecasting, or similar time-series tasks. This architecture is tailored to enhance predictive accuracy while mitigating overfitting risks.
